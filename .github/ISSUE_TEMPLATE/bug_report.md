## Thank you for reporting this issue! üôè

We appreciate you taking the time to help improve the Firecrawl n8n community node. Your feedback helps us make the integration better for everyone.

### üî• Quick Alternative
If you're experiencing issues and need an immediate solution, we recommend trying the **official Firecrawl node** available directly in n8n:
1. Search for "Firecrawl" in the n8n node panel
2. The official node should be readily available

**However, please still submit this issue!** We want to know about problems you're facing so we can improve this community node.
